# Aviation-Searching-Algorithm
During COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world put stricter restrictions on international flights. A great deal of flights have been cancelled, which has negatively affected travellers' life. To tackle the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, I and my friend Alan are designing a program: Aviation Searching Algorithm, to track availability of flights. We will write 2 modules, one for the airline company to determine availability, another one for customers to track availability. Further, we may also construct a frontend and a backend to enable the program to run on the internet. In one word, this project will show how technology transform people's life.
